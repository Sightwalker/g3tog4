extends Node

# Hi! This project is aimed to help people migrate their projects from Godot 3 to Godot 4!
# Please check the other scripts (besides the player one, that one is just basic movement) for 
# examples on how to do things on Godot 4 and how things were done on Godot 3.
#
# For now, the waiting_area.gd script has all the examples, which I intend to update when I have time.
#
# I want to expant on what I've already added and I want to explain classes like FileAccess (previously File)
# and DirAccess (previously Directiory).
# I also want to talk about how Tweens changed, how Control nodes have drastically changed behind the curtains
# and talk briefly about Array name changes.
#
# Don't know what else to say, so if you have any questions feel free to hit the issues section! :Dc
